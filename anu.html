        <h1> Thanksgiving Update 11/06/2022 </h1>

        <p> I did some more for Thanksgiving and hopefully this update is more timed and this will be update like every day. I am so sorry for doing this 2 days late, I was planning it to be on the 4th but sadly a power outage struck so I had to do it two days left. </p>

        <h1> Coding Languages update. Posted on November 1 2022 </h1>
        <p> I will not just be using HTML but CSS for this website. In the future, I might include JavaScript and hopefully move to a website rather then this file. </p>

        <h1> Halloween Update 10/31/2022 </h1>

        <p> Like I said, I can't do a lot for Halloween but I'll make it better for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Stay tuned for updates... and keep your eyes out. Bye coder. EDIT: CSS will come to this website and more advanced HTML, so I'll make more for Thanksgiving. The picture however will stay through Halloween, and November 1st. I'll remove it Wednesday, November 2nd or sooner if I want. I'll probably not put it later because I already have a few ideas for a Thanksgiving photo and yes it's related to Turkey, of course it is. </p>
