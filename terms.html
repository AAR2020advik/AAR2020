    <h2> I: Plagerism </h2>
    <p> Here at Advik Inc., we make everything authentic and take coding courses but add our own twists to everything. The photos were using a logomaker template app but we made our own twists to it. We expect you do 
      NOT copy our code. This website is not an engine website and nobody is eligible to steal the source code. Instead, please fork the github code if you would like to make a similiar
      website. </p>
