    <p> Here at Advik Inc., we make everything authentic and take coding courses but add our own twists to everything. The photo was using a logomaker template app but we made our own twists to it. We expect you do NOT inspect our google code which even if you do, it can't actually do any good work since the code is in a private file in Sublime Text. </p>
